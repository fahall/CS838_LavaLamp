Water
=====

The water project is an example project that uses the PhysBAM code base. The purpose of this project is to run a simple water simulation. In order to compile this project you must
first install the Geometry portion of the PhysBAM library under the directory $PHYSBAM/PhysBAM_Geometry. Once this is complete place this water project under $PHYSBAM/Projects/Levelset. You
can then build the Levelset project using scons.

In order to run parallel algorithms the tools library must be compiled with the appropriate flags. For use of MPI it must be compiled with USE_MPI=1 and USE_LAM=1 which can be specified within
the Sconstruct.options file. To run with threads you must modify the compile flags to add -DUSE_PTHREADS. Note that threading in PhysBAM in still in the experimental stages and thus the
results may not be as good as they will be in the future.

This project and PhysBAM are govered by the BSD license as found in PhysBAM_Copyright.txt found in the PhysBAM library.

We have inserted gravity inside WATER_DRIVER.cpp, noted in the file with 'gravity'
we have placed the water in the center of the grid, this is inside WATER_EXAMPLE.h, noted by wlbnd
we have implemented a no slip boundary along the walls, inside WATER_EXAMPLE.CPP.
we have observed significant errors associated with mass due to level sets.
we have edited the main.cpp file, adding a shorcut for resolution and frames run.
we have heavily modified the original source code for our purposes.
wtrst finds where we added the phi values for water vs air in the code.
added externalForce in water_driver currently just returns gravity
added many cout trying to find a way to look at size of arrays, trying to get count of cells from this operation.

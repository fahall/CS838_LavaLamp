* Created barebones LAYOUT, DRIVER, main files, SConscript, and this README to get things started.  Figured this would be a good place to pass messages.
* main.cpp : creates layout, creates driver, and calls driver.run()
* DRIVER.cpp (and .h) : run(), Simulate_Frame() are written; TODO -- Simulate_Time_Step() 
* LAYOUT.CPP (and .h) :
